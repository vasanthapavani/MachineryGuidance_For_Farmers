	<div class="hg">
	<p> The first 'sprayer' was used in the USA in the 1850s to protect potatoes from the Colorado Beetle; it had a knapsack tank but no pump so the spray was fed by gravity to two “sprinklers”. A pump on the knapsack began when the fungicide Bordeaux mixture was discovered in France.</p>
